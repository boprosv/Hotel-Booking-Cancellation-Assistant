# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Assistant

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Assistant is a powerful AI-powered tool that predicts the probability of a hotel booking being canceled based on historical data. It allows users to interact with booking data through natural language queries and receive real-time insights.

How Does It Work?

 Data Processing & Model Training
Loads historical hotel booking data (booking.csv).
Cleans and prepares the data by:
Removing unnecessary columns (e.g., date of reservation).
Converting categorical features into machine-readable format.
Handling missing values.
Uses XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):
Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%).
Trains a machine learning model to predict whether a booking will be canceled.
Optimizes the model using Optuna (an automated hyperparameter tuning library).

After running the model I got this score, which is pretty good for this type of Business problem.

Predicts the probability of cancellation for each booking.
Saves the results into a CSV file:
booking_cancellation_probabilities_full.csv ‚Üí Full dataset with probabilities.

This AI-powered web application helps hotel managers and analysts explore and analyze hotel booking cancellation data in an interactive and user-friendly way. It allows users to ask questions in natural language, and the AI automatically converts them into valid Pandas queries to retrieve relevant booking data.

The app is built using Streamlit, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model, and Pandas to provide a seamless data exploration experience.
